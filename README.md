This repository contains multiple calculus and Linear Algebra problems solved step by step and accompanied with visualization. All the problems were solved as part of the Calculus Class (CS111A) or Linear Algebra (CS111B) in Minerva Schools at KGI, taught by professor Lucas Tambasco.
The Final Deep Dive set was finished in collaboration with Liuda Serohina and Gera Valdez.
